‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow
User Authentication & Data Input: The user securely signs into their account (managed by Firebase) and inputs their financial details through the intuitive React.js interface.

API Request: The frontend securely transmits the user's data to the FastAPI backend.

Automated Workflow Trigger: The backend can trigger n8n workflows for pre-processing data or handling specific automated tasks.

Intelligent Prompt Construction: The backend constructs a detailed, multi-layered prompt containing the user's data and specific instructions designed to guide the AI and minimize hallucinations.

AI-Powered Analysis: The prompt is sent to the Azure OpenAI service, which analyzes the user's situation and generates a comprehensive financial plan.

Response to Frontend: The backend receives the generated plan and sends it back to the React frontend.

Display Results: The frontend displays the personalized financial plan to the user in a clear and understandable format.
